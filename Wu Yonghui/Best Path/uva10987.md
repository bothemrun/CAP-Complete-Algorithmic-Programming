- case 1: if(exist k s.t. d[i][k] + d[k][j] < d[i][j]) --> need better measurements
- then for k != i && k != j :
- case 2: else if(exist k s.t. d[i][k] + d[k][j] == d[i][j]) --> i j connected by 2 or more edges, don't need 1 direct cable
- case 3: else if(for all k, d[i][k] + d[k][j] > d[i][j]) --> need to add 1 direct cable between i j
